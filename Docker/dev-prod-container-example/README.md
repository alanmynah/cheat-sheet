This is an example to show how to work with:

- Multiple containers:
  - dev container `dev.Dockerfile` - it is not `.dev` for intellisense reasons.
  - ci container - it's the same as `dev.Dockerfile`, but has CI=true env variable set.
  - prod container `Dockerfile` that uses multistep build to serve the app with nginx
- TravisCI, [the config is here)(../../.travis.yml)
- Elastic beanstalk

Dev docker

```sh
docker-compose run --build
```

Prod docker

```sh
docker build . # Ð¡opy <image-id>
# Default nginx port is 80
docker run -p 8080:80 <image-id>
```
